# Airgead Banking App – CS-210 Project

## Project Summary
This project focused on building a C++ application to calculate and display investment growth over time.  
Users can enter their initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years they plan to invest.  

The program outputs two growth tables:  
1. Without additional monthly deposits  
2. With additional monthly deposits  

This demonstrates how compound interest and consistent contributions affect long-term savings.

## What I Did Well
I organized my code into modular functions and ensured calculations were accurate.  
The program produces neat, easy-to-read tables with clear formatting.  
I also wrote detailed comments, making the code more understandable.

---

## Areas for Improvement
- Add stronger input validation (e.g., reject negative numbers or invalid input).  
- Optimize calculation loops for better efficiency.  
- These improvements would make the program more secure, user-friendly, and scalable.

---

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Implementing the compound interest formula correctly and formatting the output.  
- Solution: Broke down the formula into smaller steps, tested each part, and used debugging tools.  
- Resources: Course material, C++ references, and Stack Overflow.

---

## Tools and Resources Added
- C++ Reference Library (cppreference.com)  
- Stack Overflow for syntax and logic help  
- IDE Debugger to step through calculations  

---

## Transferable Skills
- Writing modular and maintainable code  
- Using clear documentation and comments  
- Implementing input/output formatting for better user experience  
- Applying mathematical formulas in code  

---

## Maintainability and Adaptability
I ensured the program was maintainable by:  
- Using clear variable names  
- Adding inline comments for logic  
- Separating calculations into modular functions  
- Structuring code for future features (e.g., exporting results to a file)  

---

## Files Included
- `main.cpp` – Main driver of the program  
- Additional `.cpp` and `.h` files
- `README.md` – Reflection and overview
